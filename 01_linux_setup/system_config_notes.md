# üîê PostgreSQL Configuration Notes (Ubuntu)

This doc summarizes the core PostgreSQL config files I modified during the setup process, along with why I did it.

---

## üîß `postgresql.conf`
Located at: `/etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf`

- Changed `listen_addresses`:
  ```conf
  listen_addresses = '*'


Allows the DB to accept remote connections (useful when testing client apps or remote psql).

Optional: tune memory and logging for testing

shared_buffers = 256MB
logging_collector = on
log_directory = 'log'
log_filename = 'postgresql-%a.log'


üîê pg_hba.conf

Located at: /etc/postgresql/14/main/pg_hba.conf
I added this line for trusted local access (for testing):

local   all             postgres                                trust

This lets me connect as the postgres user without a password temporarily.

For remote connections (if needed):

host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0               md5

Allows external IPs with password (don't use in prod without firewalls!).



üî• UFW (Firewall)
Enabled UFW and allowed PostgreSQL port:

sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow 5432/tcp

Ensures only port 5432 is open externally.

üí¨ Notes to Self:
I liked seeing how everything in PostgreSQL is file-driven. It helped me understand what config means under the hood. Next time, I want to automate these tweaks using a shell script or Ansible.

### ‚ùå What NOT to paste:
You do **not** need to paste:
- Anything about `README.md`
- Git commands (`git add`, etc.)
- My explanation text
- Instructions meant for chat (like "Do you want me to...")

Once saved locally, you can upload it to GitHub like this:
